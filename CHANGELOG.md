Arekuzu - Minecraft Beta 1.7.3

So i've been working on this texture pack for a while that isn't exactly pony themed in some places so it works for normal minecraft.

- Thanks to BlackDutchie for his moon and being a tester.
- Thanks to Orshcmann whose paintings i've slapped in last minute.
- And thanks to all the people in mumble who tried my pack.

New update : 14th August
-Huge block overhaul 

# 16 September 2011
Hazzat - Minecraft Beta 1.8.

I just finished a potential 1.8 version (sorry to burst your bubble outa). I don't have Minecraft on this computer though and minecraft.net is down right now meaning I can't download it, so it would be nice if you guys could be the beta testers. The melons are the only thing I'm a bit iffy about, but I'm pleased with the rest. Be ruthless when critiquing, I want to make this as good as possible.

# 26 September 2011
Hazzat - Minecraft Beta 1.9.

I've updated it for 1.9! All the new blocks and items are in there, and mushroom biomes look a bit trippy. Mooshrooms (y'know, the cows with mushrooms on them) look like Screwball and - against my better judgement - chickens are now bright orange with a purple mane, making them look like Scootaloo. I hope you're happy.

EDIT: Hold up, I need to fix the chickens. Wait a minute while I upload the fixed one.

EDIT 2: Fixed 'em. Download away!

# 09 October 2011
Hazzat - Minecraft Beta 1.9 Pre-Release 3.

Another update! The pack is now compatible with 1.9pre3, but I would recommend updating even if you haven't been playing with that because the stone brick texture actually looks good now. I explored a stronghold with it on, the whole place looked squeaky clean.

All the new blocks in items are in. Notable additions include:
- Eye of Ender? Elements of Harmony.
- Chests are red again, as they were before 1.8 changed them.*
- Spider eyes are berries (although I'm not satisfied with them, expect their look to change at some point).
- Fixed up a few visual glitches around the dyes.
- The moon is how it was before I took over. No more Nightmare Moon!
- Green records are green again, not purple. That should simplify things with all the new records coming in.
- The single white pixel next to the rose is gone. As cute as it looked, it didn't belong.
- The book on the enchantment table is the book from the start of episode 1! It took me ages to do that.

*Ah, it seems I forgot to change double chests, so they're still brown. I'll fix that in the next update (either 1.9pre4 or actual 1.9).

# 15 October 2011
Hazzat - Minecraft Beta 1.9 Pre-Release 4.

New update! The wolves took me the longest of all, I hope you like 'em.

Here's what we've got:

Now compatible with 1.9pre4!
- Updated White Stone texture
- The End portals (slot the Elements of Harmony in them!)
- Moon phases in which Nightmare Moon appears and fades away
- Wolves now look like Winona (Applejack's dog)
- New glistering melon
- Updated cauldron texture
- Updated spider eye
- Updated fermented spider eye
- Updated melon and pumpkin stalks
- Updated bed icon so it's the same colours as the bed itself
- Slightly updated Scootachicken texture (you won't notice it, but trust me when I say it looks better)

Some visual glitch fixes:
- Ferns no longer have a line across the top of them
- You can now see when you have planted a seed
- Double chests are now red, as well as regular ones
- Fixed a random white spot in the pack logo

# 12 November 2011
Hazzat - Minecraft Beta 1.9 Pre-Release 6.

Not so many updates this time, but here they are:
- New boss health meter
- New dragon egg
- Updated mossy stone brick (is now less mossy)
- Updated cracked stone brick (is now more cracked)
- Updated chests and double chests
- Updated experience bar

Fixes:
- Alchemy GUI corners and colours fixed

I looked into making lava rainbows, but apparently all the animated blocks are hard-coded into the game so you can only change lava's animation by installing MCPatcher.

EDIT: I forgot to add the smooze. I'll include that after the next pre-release (which doesn't seem too far away).

# 12 November 2011
Hazzat - Minecraft Beta 1.9 Pre-Release 6 Version 2.

Second update today, there was something I forgot to add.
- Slimes are now the smooze

And if you don't know what the smooze is then you don't know your My Little Pony history well enough: (Video Unavailable)

As a knock-on effect of this:
- Slimeballs are now purple
- Sticky pistons are purple on the sticky end

# 19 November 2011
Hazzat - Minecraft 1.0.

Updated! This'll be the last one for a while.
- Enderdragon is Nightmare Moon!
- The crystals that heal the Enderdragon have the mane six's cutie marks
- Darkened iron bars a bit
- Fixed the above Mine Little Pony armour bugs (and diamond helmets)
The only problem with Mine Little Pony now is diamond leggings, and as far as I can see there's no way around with without completely changing the design of diamond leggings.

# 12 January 2012
Hazzat - Minecraft 1.1.

Minecraft 1.1 is here, and so is the new Love and Tolerance! Even if you're not on 1.1 yet, it's worth updating.
Many thanks to HeadPikachu, I've "borrowed" a lot of her textures (but I did ask her first!)

What's new:
- New water and lava (which you need something like Optifine for)
- Golden apples are now Zap Apples
- Spawn eggs added
- New giant mushroom textures

Also the following new mob textures, all by HeadPikachu:

- Cows
- Squid
- Wolves
- Villagers
- Default Steve skin (which I think will make him a pony in the Mine Little Pony mod. If not, oh well!)

I do want this to be the most popular pony pack on Planet Minecraft!

To do list (suggestions are welcome!):
- Vary the cow texture a bit more, instead of it being just plain brown and white.
- Reduce the variation in the mooshroom texture.
- Make the experience bar a rainbow.
- Make magma creams purple to match slimeballs.
- Maybe give slimes a mouth to make them more like the Smooze.
- Neaten mossy stone bricks.
- Fix a little bug with the eyes of spiders.
- Make tamed wolves look less creepy

# 01 March 2012
Hazzat - Minecraft 1.2.

Minecraft 1.2 is here, and so is the new L&T update!

New things:
- Redstone lamp
- Circle stone brick
- Jungle wood
- Jungle leaves
- Jungle sapling

Updated things:
- New title screen background
- The experience bar is now a rainbow
- Stone bricks (regular, mossy and cracked) are finally in a state I can feel happy with!
- Magma creams are purple to match slimeballs
- Rotten flesh (still not happy with it though)
- Tamed wolves look less creepy
- Cows look a bit better
- Gold nuggets are now bits (I know you RPers like using them as money)
- The default Steve skin makes you a pony with Mine Little Pony, and it looks better than it did in the last update

â€‹Misc:
- It's also now compatible with Optifine's new "connected textures" setting! So y'all can go wild with that.

![Update Image](https://i.imgur.com/pVAD2.png)

# 22 March 2012
Hazzat - Minecraft 1.2.4.

Another update, another update.
- New sandstone hieroglyph textures
- New shades of wooden planks
- Iron Golem is now Iron Will (don't hit him or he'll get MAAAAD)
- New pig texture
- New "unknown pack" image
- New languages button. I'm an idiot for forgetting it before
- Lots of little tweaks to things like redstone lamps

# 15 July 2012
Hazzat - Minecraft 1.3(nearly).

Dinnerbone has said that there won't be any more features added until 1.3, only bugfixes. So it must be safe to release a 1.3-ready texture pack, right?

I hope StrongBad isn't annoyed at me doing this slightly prematurely...

New textures:
- Emeralds
- Emerald ore
- Emerald block
- Tripwire
- Tripwire hook
- Cocoa bean plants
- Book & Quill
- Signed book
- Brewing stand
- Trading GUI
- Ender chest
- Spider
- Armour icons in the inventory

Updated textures:
- Vines! (The old ones were so ugly!)
- Jungle leaves
- Creative mode inventory Note: if you're using this version of the pack in 1.2.5, the Creative mode inventory will look broken. Still works though!
- Enchanting GUI
- Critical hit sparks
- Chest
- Moon
- Steve
- Cow
- Diamond leggings (now show up in the Mine Little pony mod!)
- Leather leggings (now show up in the Mine Little Pony mod!)
- Pumpkin stalk

- Title screen backdrop
- Title screen logo! Designed by PandaTork
- Splash screen (don't sue me Hasbro)
- Tweaks of graphical errors everywhere (e.g. the bed's pillow)
- Snow
- Other stuff I forgot

The best improvements yet, I think. Enjoy the new update, and enjoy 1.3!

# 22 July 2012
Hazzat - Minecraft 1.3?.

Small update!
Anyone who uses Optifine/Mcpatcher's "Connected Textures" setting will know that the glass textures in this pack were a little... off. After much tweaking and being confused, I've managed to fix it to the glass textures are all in the right place and don't jump around when you place more glass blocks.

If you do not use Connected Textures, this update is irrelevant to you and you do not need to update.
Download from the usual place.

> Could you make an mcforum link too, because pmc usually becomes full, overloded, or whatever happens. ~ _CheeseManFuu_


When this is the most popular pony-themed pack, we'll talk about hosting it elsewhere. ;)

# 09 August 2012
Hazzat - Minecraft 1.3 - part 2.

Update!

Do you use Mine Little Pony? Seeing as you're looking at a page for a pony-themed texture pack on a pony-themed forum for a pony-themed Minecraft server, chances are you do. If you use MineLP, this update is relevant to you!

The new MineLP update features a new shape for armour on ponies that actually fits them properly. Previously it would borrow the helmet and chestplate textures and put them on the pony, which would look a little odd and meant you wouldn't be able to see the whole texture. But no longer!

![Update Image](https://i.imgur.com/XQdo8.png)

[More cutesy-wootsey CMC screenshots here](https://imgur.com/a/am7ww#1)

The new armour shape will only show up if your texture pack supports it, and this update does!

New textures:
- Pony armour (all types - leather, iron, gold, diamond, chain)

Updated textures:
- Redstone lamp

Misc:
- Halved the file size

# 14 November 2012
Hazzat - Minecraft 1.4.4.

A seasonal variation of Love & Tolerance

The winter version features changes such as:
- colder grass, sky, fog and a few other things.
- fuzzy leather armour to keep you warm.
- a festive chocolate cake.
- a new title screen and logo.

...and more! You'll have to find the rest for yourself.

Have a tolerable day!

I'll make a thread for the new pack, although I don't expect it to see much use.

Thanks so much for the support. I really mean it, I love working on this pack and it's the people who use it who make all that time worth it. And I miss you Arekuzu!

"Accept no imitations!"

# 02 April 2013
Hazzat - Minecraft 1.5 - Love & Tolerance Spring Edition

The second seasonal variation of The Love & Tolerance Texture Pack!

IMPORTANT- This pack requires.MCPatcher.or Optifine! If don't use either, the pack will look very strange...

This texture pack:
- is brightly coloured, but not pink and girly! Just like the show.
- features pony pictures as paintings.
- is not so different from the default textures that your construction will look completely different.
- is most probably the best way to explore Equestria.

The spring version features changes such as:
- grass, sky, fog and a few other things are a wildly different colour!
- the floor is covered with pretty flowers!
- pretty pack logo!
- new menu backgrounds!

...and more? Maybe? I don't know, I don't keep track of these things.

# 01 July 2013
Hazzat - Minecraft 1.6

It's time for the Horse Update! Hey, it's not quite ponies, [but remember what Notch said about ponies in Minecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A42YTr6sUho)?

New textures
- Absolutely tons of connected/random/animated textures courtesy of my partner in crime Hawkseye21. They're really cool! (Requires MCPatcher)
- Hardened clay (and its various stained colours)
- Coal block
- Hay block
- Portal
- Top of birch/spruce/jungle log
- Name tag
- Lead
- Charcoal
- Horse inventory
- Horse jump bar
- Horse hearts
- Wheat
- Spawn egg
- Fire charge
- Magma cube
- Portal

Updated textures
- Spider eye
- Fermented spider eye
- Cookie (muffin)
- Gold nugget
- Firework rocket
- Baked potato
- Splash potion bottle

Sounds
- Clip-clop footstep sounds when walking on stone
- Villager noises (courtesy of lphemphill)

Misc
- New title screen splashes! (That's the bouncy yellow text you see on the main menu.) There's 320 of them, so hopefully it should take a while for you to see them all
- A treat for anyone who watches the Minecraft credits all the way through
- Small changes to language files (Slime -> Smooze)
- HD font is removed for the time being because 1.6 can't handle it. (HD font still works if you use MCPatcher!)

This version is totally incompatible with Minecraft 1.5.2 and below!
If you'd like to download the pack for use with 1.5, it's still available here.

# 08 August 2013
Hazzat - Minecraft 1.6 v2

I did an update! Apparently there was some stuff broken in the 1.6 version, so I fixed it all (I think).

Fixed things
- MCPatcher stuff
- Some item names (cookie = muffin, potion = cider)
- Cobblestone and stone brick textures swapped
- Pony armour is in the right place
- Optifine compatibility...? _It works for me, but who knows if it'll work for everyone, this stuff is scary and complicated_

# 10 August 2013
Hazzat - Minecraft 1.6 - Love & Tolerance Spring Edition

Updated for 1.6! All the new blocks, items and features from the main pack are carried over too. 

# 29 August 2013
Hazzat - Minecraft 1.6 v3

Thanks for pointing out the absorption effect thing, I had no idea that even existed.

Another update...

Mine Little Pony updated for 1.6.2, and I needed to move some stuff in the pack around so it all works properly. I'm really sorry about this, I hate updating the texture pack too much because it means everyone else has to pay attention to keep up. But this is necessary if you like MineLP!

Fixed things
- Pony armour works again
- Zombie and skeleton ponies show up properly
- Pony villagers show up properly
- I moved the gold nugget ("Bit") texture down one pixel because it looks much better that way
- Absorption potion effect hearts
- I removed the saddlebag design from the inventory, because no one could ever tell what it was meant to be. I'll redraw it someday!

# 30 August 2013
Hazzat - Minecraft 1.6 v2 - Love & Tolerance Spring Edition

Apparently the last update didn't work at all. Uh, silly me I guess!

All fixed now. 

# 13 February 2014
Hazzat - Minecraft 1.7.4

1.7.4 UPDATE! It's been a far-too-long time coming, I know.

We've got:
- Custom records! Now the in-game records play remixes of MLP songs, or MLP-inspired songs.
- Flowers! (sunflower, daisy, tulip, azure bluet, allium, blue orchid, lilac, rose bush, peony)
- Other plants! (double tallgrass, large fern, acacia sapling, big oak sapling)
- Trees! (acacia logs, big oak logs, acacia planks, big oak planks)
- Podzol...!
- Stained glass!
- Packed ice!
- Fish! (salmon, cooked salmon, pufferfish, clownfish)
- Cave spiders are star spiders

Thank you for sticking around. L&T isn't dead, and I hope to keep working on it for many updates to come.

On top of that, I redid the stained clays so they look more like the colours they're meant to be:

![Update Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/8ljPxP0.png)

I edited the font to round it off a bit, and toned down references in item names, as I figured they could get annoying for some people.

Download from Planet Minecraft

But wait, there's more! There's are music-free and music-only versions for people who like to customise their Minecraft. You can read about them in the first post.

As usual, MCPatcher is recommended so you get all the features.

Thank you for sticking around. L&T isn't dead, and I hope to keep working on it for many updates to come.
