Hazzat - Minecraft 1.7.4

1.7.4 UPDATE! It's been a far-too-long time coming, I know.

We've got:
- Custom records! Now the in-game records play remixes of MLP songs, or MLP-inspired songs.
- Flowers! (sunflower, daisy, tulip, azure bluet, allium, blue orchid, lilac, rose bush, peony)
- Other plants! (double tallgrass, large fern, acacia sapling, big oak sapling)
- Trees! (acacia logs, big oak logs, acacia planks, big oak planks)
- Podzol...!
- Stained glass!
- Packed ice!
- Fish! (salmon, cooked salmon, pufferfish, clownfish)
- Cave spiders are star spiders

Thank you for sticking around. L&T isn't dead, and I hope to keep working on it for many updates to come.

On top of that, I redid the stained clays so they look more like the colours they're meant to be:

I edited the font to round it off a bit, and toned down references in item names, as I figured they could get annoying for some people.

But wait, there's more! There's are music-free and music-only versions for people who like to customise their Minecraft. You can read about them in the first post.

As usual, MCPatcher is recommended so you get all the features.
