Silk Rose - Minecraft Java 1.19-1.129.2 & 1.19.3+, and Bedrock 1.19+ - L&T 1.3.0

This release features a completely reworked download system, no longer relying on pre-generated zip files, instead it uses a client-side builder, giving us much more granular control over how downloads work. With this, we have been able to increase the number of add-ons, and we have also added in a section for mod support. Also, we have a new downgrades system which means we can release for multiple versions of Java Minecraft at once, with this release we are releasing for 1.19 to 1.19.2 and 1.19.3.

This release was brought to you by @SilkRose, @ZeldaLinkAaron, @keupoz, @Langtanium, @autumnblazey, Nebbie, @ashy1227, @AtomicGlow and @Venaf.
