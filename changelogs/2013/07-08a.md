Hazzat - Minecraft 1.6 v2

I did an update! Apparently there was some stuff broken in the 1.6 version, so I fixed it all (I think).

Fixed things
- MCPatcher stuff
- Some item names (cookie = muffin, potion = cider)
- Cobblestone and stone brick textures swapped
- Pony armour is in the right place
- Optifine compatibility...? _It works for me, but who knows if it'll work for everyone, this stuff is scary and complicated_
