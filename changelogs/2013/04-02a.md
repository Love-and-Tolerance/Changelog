Hazzat - Minecraft 1.5 - Love & Tolerance Spring Edition

The second seasonal variation of The Love & Tolerance Texture Pack!

IMPORTANT- This pack requires.MCPatcher.or Optifine! If don't use either, the pack will look very strange...

This texture pack:
- is brightly coloured, but not pink and girly! Just like the show.
- features pony pictures as paintings.
- is not so different from the default textures that your construction will look completely different.
- is most probably the best way to explore Equestria.

The spring version features changes such as:
- grass, sky, fog and a few other things are a wildly different colour!
- the floor is covered with pretty flowers!
- pretty pack logo!
- new menu backgrounds!

...and more? Maybe? I don't know, I don't keep track of these things.
