Hazzat - Minecraft 1.6

It's time for the Horse Update! Hey, it's not quite ponies, [but remember what Notch said about ponies in Minecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A42YTr6sUho)?

New textures
- Absolutely tons of connected/random/animated textures courtesy of my partner in crime Hawkseye21. They're really cool! (Requires MCPatcher)
- Hardened clay (and its various stained colours)
- Coal block
- Hay block
- Portal
- Top of birch/spruce/jungle log
- Name tag
- Lead
- Charcoal
- Horse inventory
- Horse jump bar
- Horse hearts
- Wheat
- Spawn egg
- Fire charge
- Magma cube
- Portal

Updated textures
- Spider eye
- Fermented spider eye
- Cookie (muffin)
- Gold nugget
- Firework rocket
- Baked potato
- Splash potion bottle

Sounds
- Clip-clop footstep sounds when walking on stone
- Villager noises (courtesy of lphemphill)

Misc
- New title screen splashes! (That's the bouncy yellow text you see on the main menu.) There's 320 of them, so hopefully it should take a while for you to see them all
- A treat for anyone who watches the Minecraft credits all the way through
- Small changes to language files (Slime -> Smooze)
- HD font is removed for the time being because 1.6 can't handle it. (HD font still works if you use MCPatcher!)

This version is totally incompatible with Minecraft 1.5.2 and below!
If you'd like to download the pack for use with 1.5, it's still available here.
