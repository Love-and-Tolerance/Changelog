Hazzat - Minecraft 1.6 v3

Thanks for pointing out the absorption effect thing, I had no idea that even existed.

Another update...

Mine Little Pony updated for 1.6.2, and I needed to move some stuff in the pack around so it all works properly. I'm really sorry about this, I hate updating the texture pack too much because it means everyone else has to pay attention to keep up. But this is necessary if you like MineLP!

Fixed things
- Pony armour works again
- Zombie and skeleton ponies show up properly
- Pony villagers show up properly
- I moved the gold nugget ("Bit") texture down one pixel because it looks much better that way
- Absorption potion effect hearts
- I removed the saddlebag design from the inventory, because no one could ever tell what it was meant to be. I'll redraw it someday!
