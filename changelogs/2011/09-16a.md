Hazzat - Minecraft Beta 1.8.

I just finished a potential 1.8 version (sorry to burst your bubble outa). I don't have Minecraft on this computer though and minecraft.net is down right now meaning I can't download it, so it would be nice if you guys could be the beta testers. The melons are the only thing I'm a bit iffy about, but I'm pleased with the rest. Be ruthless when critiquing, I want to make this as good as possible.
