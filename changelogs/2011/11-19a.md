Hazzat - Minecraft 1.0.

Updated! This'll be the last one for a while.
- Enderdragon is Nightmare Moon!
- The crystals that heal the Enderdragon have the mane six's cutie marks
- Darkened iron bars a bit
- Fixed the above Mine Little Pony armour bugs (and diamond helmets)
The only problem with Mine Little Pony now is diamond leggings, and as far as I can see there's no way around with without completely changing the design of diamond leggings.
