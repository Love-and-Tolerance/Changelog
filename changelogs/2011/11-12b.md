Hazzat - Minecraft Beta 1.9 Pre-Release 6 Version 2.

Second update today, there was something I forgot to add.
- Slimes are now the smooze

And if you don't know what the smooze is then you don't know your My Little Pony history well enough: (Video Unavailable)

As a knock-on effect of this:
- Slimeballs are now purple
- Sticky pistons are purple on the sticky end
