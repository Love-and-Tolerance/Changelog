Hazzat - Minecraft Beta 1.9 Pre-Release 6.

Not so many updates this time, but here they are:
- New boss health meter
- New dragon egg
- Updated mossy stone brick (is now less mossy)
- Updated cracked stone brick (is now more cracked)
- Updated chests and double chests
- Updated experience bar

Fixes:
- Alchemy GUI corners and colours fixed

I looked into making lava rainbows, but apparently all the animated blocks are hard-coded into the game so you can only change lava's animation by installing MCPatcher.

EDIT: I forgot to add the smooze. I'll include that after the next pre-release (which doesn't seem too far away).
