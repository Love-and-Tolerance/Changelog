Hazzat - Minecraft Beta 1.9 Pre-Release 3.

Another update! The pack is now compatible with 1.9pre3, but I would recommend updating even if you haven't been playing with that because the stone brick texture actually looks good now. I explored a stronghold with it on, the whole place looked squeaky clean.

All the new blocks in items are in. Notable additions include:
- Eye of Ender? Elements of Harmony.
- Chests are red again, as they were before 1.8 changed them.*
- Spider eyes are berries (although I'm not satisfied with them, expect their look to change at some point).
- Fixed up a few visual glitches around the dyes.
- The moon is how it was before I took over. No more Nightmare Moon!
- Green records are green again, not purple. That should simplify things with all the new records coming in.
- The single white pixel next to the rose is gone. As cute as it looked, it didn't belong.
- The book on the enchantment table is the book from the start of episode 1! It took me ages to do that.

*Ah, it seems I forgot to change double chests, so they're still brown. I'll fix that in the next update (either 1.9pre4 or actual 1.9).
