Hazzat - Minecraft Beta 1.9.

I've updated it for 1.9! All the new blocks and items are in there, and mushroom biomes look a bit trippy. Mooshrooms (y'know, the cows with mushrooms on them) look like Screwball and - against my better judgement - chickens are now bright orange with a purple mane, making them look like Scootaloo. I hope you're happy.

EDIT: Hold up, I need to fix the chickens. Wait a minute while I upload the fixed one.

EDIT 2: Fixed 'em. Download away!
