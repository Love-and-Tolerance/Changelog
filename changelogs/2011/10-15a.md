Hazzat - Minecraft Beta 1.9 Pre-Release 4.

New update! The wolves took me the longest of all, I hope you like 'em.

Here's what we've got:

Now compatible with 1.9pre4!
- Updated White Stone texture
- The End portals (slot the Elements of Harmony in them!)
- Moon phases in which Nightmare Moon appears and fades away
- Wolves now look like Winona (Applejack's dog)
- New glistering melon
- Updated cauldron texture
- Updated spider eye
- Updated fermented spider eye
- Updated melon and pumpkin stalks
- Updated bed icon so it's the same colours as the bed itself
- Slightly updated Scootachicken texture (you won't notice it, but trust me when I say it looks better)

Some visual glitch fixes:
- Ferns no longer have a line across the top of them
- You can now see when you have planted a seed
- Double chests are now red, as well as regular ones
- Fixed a random white spot in the pack logo
