Hazzat - Minecraft 1.3?.

Small update!
Anyone who uses Optifine/Mcpatcher's "Connected Textures" setting will know that the glass textures in this pack were a little... off. After much tweaking and being confused, I've managed to fix it to the glass textures are all in the right place and don't jump around when you place more glass blocks.

If you do not use Connected Textures, this update is irrelevant to you and you do not need to update.
Download from the usual place.

When this is the most popular pony-themed pack, we'll talk about hosting it elsewhere. ;)
