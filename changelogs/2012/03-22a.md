Hazzat - Minecraft 1.2.4.

Another update, another update.
- New sandstone hieroglyph textures
- New shades of wooden planks
- Iron Golem is now Iron Will (don't hit him or he'll get MAAAAD)
- New pig texture
- New "unknown pack" image
- New languages button. I'm an idiot for forgetting it before
- Lots of little tweaks to things like redstone lamps
