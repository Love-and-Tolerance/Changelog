Hazzat - Minecraft 1.4.4.

Minecraft 1.4.4 came out today with a new music disc which requires a new texture. So a new texture pack update!

I took the opportunity to tweak a lot of things that had been bugging me.

New things
- "wait" music disc (it's blue)

Updated things (most of these changes are unnoticeably tiny so don't get excited)

- Flint and steel
- Dying leather boots now lets you dye the majority of the boot
- Leather leggings and cape have been switched round (so the cape is the chestplate again)
- Moon
- Steve head now isn't bald when you place it
- Gold nugget
- Book & quill
- Fermented spider eye
- Powered minecart
- Snow
- Wither skeleton skull item
- Cauldron item
- Emerald block
- Command block
- English (UK) now actually uses UK English (it's "grey", folks)
- Other small changes to language files (eg Ender Dragon -> Nightmare Moon, Diamond -> Gem)
