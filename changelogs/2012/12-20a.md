Hazzat - Minecraft 1.4.6

Fireworks! I don't know what you're planning to use them for, but I'm going to celebrate the new update of L&T with them! (everyone groans)

New textures
- Firework rocket
- Firework star
- Enchanted book
- Dinnerbone's Christmas surprise
- Nether star
- Wither

Updated textures
- Leather armour for humans works properly now (you couldn't dye it before)
- Fixed a little error with leather leggings for ponies
- Beacon to match the new nether star
- Rain & rain droplets
- Redstone lamps (I think I've finally made them look good!)
- Language files brought up to date
- Large chest
