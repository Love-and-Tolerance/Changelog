Hazzat - Minecraft 1.4.6 - Love & Tolerance Winter Edition - Update 1

Minecraft 1.4.6 means a new texture pack update. Juggling two texture packs at the same time and trying to keep them in sync has proven less tricky than I thought it would...

New textures
- Firework rocket
- Firework star
- Enchanted book
- Dinnerbone's Christmas surprise
- Nether star
- Wither

Updated textures
- The sky is now even colder!
- Beacon to match the new nether star
- Rain & rain droplets
- Redstone lamps (I think I've finally made them look good!)
- Language files brought up to date
- Large chest
