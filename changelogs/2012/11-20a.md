Hazzat - Minecraft 1.4.5 - Love & Tolerance Winter Edition

A seasonal variation of Love & Tolerance

The winter version features changes such as:
- colder grass, sky, fog and a few other things.
- fuzzy leather armour to keep you warm.
- a festive chocolate cake.
- a new title screen and logo.

...and more! You'll have to find the rest for yourself.

Have a tolerable day!

I'll make a thread for the new pack, although I don't expect it to see much use.

Thanks so much for the support. I really mean it, I love working on this pack and it's the people who use it who make all that time worth it. And I miss you Arekuzu!
