Hazzat - Minecraft 1.1.

Minecraft 1.1 is here, and so is the new Love and Tolerance! Even if you're not on 1.1 yet, it's worth updating.
Many thanks to HeadPikachu, I've "borrowed" a lot of her textures (but I did ask her first!)

What's new:
- New water and lava (which you need something like Optifine for)
- Golden apples are now Zap Apples
- Spawn eggs added
- New giant mushroom textures

Also the following new mob textures, all by HeadPikachu:

- Cows
- Squid
- Wolves
- Villagers
- Default Steve skin (which I think will make him a pony in the Mine Little Pony mod. If not, oh well!)

I do want this to be the most popular pony pack on Planet Minecraft!

To do list (suggestions are welcome!):
- Vary the cow texture a bit more, instead of it being just plain brown and white.
- Reduce the variation in the mooshroom texture.
- Make the experience bar a rainbow.
- Make magma creams purple to match slimeballs.
- Maybe give slimes a mouth to make them more like the Smooze.
- Neaten mossy stone bricks.
- Fix a little bug with the eyes of spiders.
- Make tamed wolves look less creepy
