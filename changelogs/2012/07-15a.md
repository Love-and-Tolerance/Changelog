Hazzat - Minecraft 1.3(nearly).

Dinnerbone has said that there won't be any more features added until 1.3, only bugfixes. So it must be safe to release a 1.3-ready texture pack, right?

I hope StrongBad isn't annoyed at me doing this slightly prematurely...

New textures:
- Emeralds
- Emerald ore
- Emerald block
- Tripwire
- Tripwire hook
- Cocoa bean plants
- Book & Quill
- Signed book
- Brewing stand
- Trading GUI
- Ender chest
- Spider
- Armour icons in the inventory

Updated textures:
- Vines! (The old ones were so ugly!)
- Jungle leaves
- Creative mode inventory Note: if you're using this version of the pack in 1.2.5, the Creative mode inventory will look broken. Still works though!
- Enchanting GUI
- Critical hit sparks
- Chest
- Moon
- Steve
- Cow
- Diamond leggings (now show up in the Mine Little pony mod!)
- Leather leggings (now show up in the Mine Little Pony mod!)
- Pumpkin stalk
- Jukebox
- Melon
- Title screen backdrop
- Title screen logo! Designed by PandaTork
- Splash screen (don't sue me Hasbro)
- Tweaks of graphical errors everywhere (e.g. the bed's pillow)
- Snow
- Other stuff I forgot

The best improvements yet, I think. Enjoy the new update, and enjoy 1.3!
